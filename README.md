schemeWire is intended to provide access to the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi Scheme to programs being run by the TinyScheme interperter. 

To do this one needs:
	* TinyScheme
	* the static library and header files from wiringPi.

This projects provides extensions so that the one can access commands similar to usage with other micro-controller environments. 
The three styles being explored are : arduino, Basic Stamp and the Picaxe. A working equivalent to the arduino bareMinimum sketch has been created 
for all extensions.
